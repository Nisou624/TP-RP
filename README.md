### This is a Networks and Protocols Lab. It is divided in three parts:

- Part 1: CHATROOM  
A multi clients single server Chatroom implementation in python.  
the user code **ct.py** and server code **SMC.py** use mainly the threading and sockets modules of python.  
- Part 2: Tic Tac Toe  
A console game of Tic Tac Toe in python. this code also uses the multi client (in this case 2 players) single user architecture.
- Part 3:  
A Multiplayer (local network) fighting python game made with pygame.
    - the client code  **main_s.py** contains the game logic but also a socket and threads for communication with the server.  
    - the server code **server.py** contains the server logic that handles communication between the two players.
